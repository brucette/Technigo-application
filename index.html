        Scrum is a project management methodology, a framework for how a team should work together towards a common goal like delivering a product or service. 
        <br><br>
        The Scrum Team has no hierarchies and consists of:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Scrum Master</b> - ensures the team follows the scrum methodology.</li><br>
          <li><b>Product Owner</b> - maintains and helps prioritise the project's to-do-list.</li><br>
          <li><b>Development team</b> - self-managing group of ~ 7 members, gets the work done.
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>
        Scrum is characterised by short phases (~ 2 - 4 weeks) called <em>sprints</em>, in which project work occurs.
        <br><br>
        A sprint consists of:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Sprint Planning</b> - the team plans what work is to be performed and sets the sprint goal.</li><br>
          <li><b>Daily Scrum/Stand-up</b>  - a short daily meeting to make sure everyone is aligned with the sprint goal and to voice any potential concerns.</li><br>
          <li><b>Sprint Review</b> - the team inspects and demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders for feedback.</li><br>
          <li><b>Sprint Retrospective</b> - the team documents and discusses what went well and what needs improvement for the next sprint.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        This cycle is repeated until the entirety of the project has been delivered.
